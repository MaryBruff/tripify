## 📚 Learning Goals

- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a clear and accessible user interface
- Make network requests to retrieve data
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

## 🥇 Wins
⭐ Successfully implemented and executed FETCH calls, enhancing the application's ability to efficiently handle network requests and data retrieval.

⭐ Completed a minimum viable product for a complex project within a constrained timeline, demonstrating effective project management and technical skills.
	
## 🚧 Challenges
❗ Encountered initial difficulties in aligning the starting code with project extensions, leading to necessary revisions and backtracking.

❗ Initially prioritized functionality over aesthetic design, which resulted in a need for later refinements in the application's CSS.

❗ Faced challenges in balancing the intricate aspects of the project, requiring strategic adjustments to meet both technical and design goals.
